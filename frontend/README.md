# ACME Supermarket
implementation of the frontend with React , Redux.
the complete stack of the exercise is React-NodeJS-MongoDB
I used transpilation both on the client and on the server (jsx and typescript)
with the help of babel and webpack.

## install

client and server are two differet projects, in order to the let them work properly  <a href="https://github.com/kinotto/acme-supermarket-test/tree/master/backend">start the server</a>, then start the client:

- npm install or yarn install

- npm run start

- npm run test (to run the test)

- open the browser at localhost:3003
